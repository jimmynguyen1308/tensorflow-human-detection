## Overview

The project intends to build a simple human detection app using Tensorflow.JS. It is a repost-and-upgrade version of my old one few years ago which was heavily inspired by [ipenywis](https://github.com/ipenywis)'s [react-object-detection](https://github.com/ipenywis/react-object-detection).

## Packages
This software uses Object Detection model [coco-ssd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) from [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) list of `tfjs-models`.
<br />
Additionally, it also uses styled-component package in order to conveniently style components within the software.



__Update:__ this repository now _slightly supports_ TypeScript 

## Clone & Deployment
For clone & deployment, simply get to a directory and type these commands into the terminal
``` Linux
$ git clone https://github.com/nhatnguyen9813/human-detection-app.git
